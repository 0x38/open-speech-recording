          There are very few open source collections of speech data where individual
	  words are spoken by a large number of different people. This makes it tough to
	  build good open source examples of detecting spoken keywords such as 
	  &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;On&quot;, or &quot;Off&quot;.
	</div>
	<div class="welcome-display">
	  To fill this gap, the <a href="https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/">AIY team</a>
	  is hoping to gather single spoken words from several hundred people and then release
	  the resulting data set under an open license, together with an example of how to use
	  it to create simple speech command classifiers.

	  We need your help to make this happen! The next step is a web page that will ask
	  for permission to use your microphone, and then will ask you to say about a hundred
	  words as they appear on screen. This will take about five minutes to run through.
	  Once that's complete, you'll be able to review all the recordings you made, and then
	  if you're happy, upload them to be included in the archive. Once we have several
	  hundred people's recordings, we'll review them for quality and then make them
	  available as a download under an open source license.
	</div>
	<div class="welcome-display">
	  To ensure privacy, we won't ask for any personal details at all, and no information
	  other than the speech recordings themselves and a randomly-generated identifier for
	  each session will be stored. Please be sure you're recording this in a place where
	  there's no chance of accidentally overhearing other people's conversations in the
	  background. We recommend doing this by yourself in a room with the door closed to be
	  sure.
